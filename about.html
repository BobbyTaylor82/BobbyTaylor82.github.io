                <h1> About</h1>
                <hr>

                <p>I’m an Electrical Engineer who graduated from the University of Missouri S&T with a passion for exploring data.
                    I previously worked for Callaway Nuclear Power Plant for eight years where I utilized a team approach
                    to develop structured cause analysis methods to determine significant adverse trends. In this role, I
                    developed the ability to solve various challenges ranging from reducing unanticipated compressor downtime
                    and identifying integrity issues with the fire protection system using Excel and Wonderware eDNA software.
                     Wonderware eDNA software is a real-time data management software which bridges the gaps between information technology and operations.
                </p>

                <h3>What lead me to change my career path ???</h3>


                <p>There is a saying, " The only thing constant in life is change." In December 2016, I decided to leave to take 
                    care of my grandfather. 
                    Although this was a difficult period in my life, I knew everything happens for a reason. Callaway
                     was a great opportunity which exposed me to how companies use excel, SQL, and models to solve problems.
                      After my grandfather passed away, I continued my search for engineering opportunities and moved to Houston.</p>

                    <p>While in Houston, I discovered an emerging field called, 
                        “Data Analytics.” Around this time, I met a guy named Asela in a Data Analytics BootCamp, I attended in Houston.
                        He was far more experienced in the analytics domain than me. We would talk statistics and explore datasets using 
                        the Pandas library until the small hours of the morning. Next, I decided to take a few Udemy courses to explore this new field.
                         The classes were great!!! I got to refresh my statistics and python skills, but also learn more about exploratory data libraries,
                          such as pandas and various mapping libraries. Around this time, I also found out about kaggle and decided to explore a few datasets.
                           I figured exploring these datasets would help hone my analytical thinking skills.</p>

                    <h3>What lead me to the University of Texas at Austin???</h3>
                    

                    <p> Once, I found out about a new course offered at the University of Austin, titled, 
                        “Data Analytics and Visualization,” it was a no-brainer. Here is
                        a
                        <a href="https://techbootcamps.extendedcampus.utexas.edu/data/landing/?s=Google-Unbranded&utm_cost=0&mkwid=6TD5ilEi_dc&pkw=%2Bdata%20%2Banalytics%20%2Bcertificate&pcrid=253337694224&pmt=b&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=&utm_term=%2Bdata%20%2Banalytics%20%2Bcertificate&utm_content=253337694224&s=google&k=%2Bdata%20%2Banalytics%20%2Bcertificate&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI39f6iI7h2QIVz7rACh2_2QX6EAAYASAAEgL1GvD_BwE" target="_blank">link</a>
                        to the course curriculum. I think this is one of the best decisions I made in a long time. This course reinforced and added to my
                        data exploratory journey. Plus, this course taught me how to not only explore data but also develop
                        full-stack web applications using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Web Frameworks, SQL, non-relational and relational databases.
                    </p>

   


                    <h3>What's next after the program???</h3>
                    

                    <p>My overall goals are to learn more about statistical learning and use programming to automate the data-driven 
                        pipeline using programming languages such as python and javascript.
                         I would like an opportunity where I can use these skills to solve real-world problems.
