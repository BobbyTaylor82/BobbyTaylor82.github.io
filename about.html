                <h1> About</h1>
                <hr>

                <p>I’m an Electrical Engineer who graduated from the University of Missouri S&T with a passion for exploring data.
                    I previously worked for Callaway Nuclear Power Plant for eight years where I utilized a team approach
                    to develop structured cause analysis methods to determine significant adverse trends. In this role, I
                    developed the ability to solve various challenges ranging from reducing unanticipated compressor downtime
                    and identifying integrity issues with the fire protection system using Excel.
                </p>

                <h3>What lead me to change my career path ???</h3>


                <p>There is a saying, " The only thing constant in life is change." In December 2016, I was laid-off. 
                    Although this was a confusing period in my life, I knew  everything happens for a reason. It was a
                     great opportunity which exposed me to how companies use Excel, SQL, and Regression Models to solve problems. 
                     After applying for a few opportunities and moving to Houston, I decided to step back from the application 
                     process to really focus on a career path I would love to pursue. </p>

                <div class="col-md-12">
                    <p>After months of internet searching and talking to various people, I discovered an emerging field called, “Data Analytics.” 
                        Around this time, I met a guy named Asela in a Data Analytics BootCamp, I attended in Houston. He was far more experience 
                        in the analytics domain than me. We would talk statistics and explored datasets using the Pandas library until the small 
                        hours of the morning. Next, I decided to take a few Udemy courses to further explore this new field. The courses were great!!! 
                        I got to refresh my statistics and python skills, but also learn more about data exploratory libraries, such as pandas and 
                        various mapping libraries. Around this time, I also found out about kaggle and decided to explore a few datasets. I figured 
                        exploring these datasets would help hone my statistical thinking skills.</p>

                    <h3>What lead me to the University of Texas at Austin???</h3>
                    

                    <p> Once, I found about a new course offered at the University of Austin, titled, 
                        “Data Analytics and Visualization”, it was a no-brainer. Here is
                        a
                        <a href="https://techbootcamps.extendedcampus.utexas.edu/data/landing/?s=Google-Unbranded&utm_cost=0&mkwid=6TD5ilEi_dc&pkw=%2Bdata%20%2Banalytics%20%2Bcertificate&pcrid=253337694224&pmt=b&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=&utm_term=%2Bdata%20%2Banalytics%20%2Bcertificate&utm_content=253337694224&s=google&k=%2Bdata%20%2Banalytics%20%2Bcertificate&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI39f6iI7h2QIVz7rACh2_2QX6EAAYASAAEgL1GvD_BwE" target="_blank">link</a>
                        to the course curriculum. I think this is one of the best decision I made in a long time. This course reinforced and added to my
                        data exploratory journey. Plus, this course taught me how to not only explore data, but also develop
                        full-stack web applications using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Web Frameworks, SQL, non-relational and relational databases.
                    </p>

   


                    <h3>What's next after the program???</h3>
                    

                    <p> My overall goals is to learn more about statistical learning and use programming to automate the data-driven pipeline. I would like an opportunity where I can use these skills to solve real-world problems.
